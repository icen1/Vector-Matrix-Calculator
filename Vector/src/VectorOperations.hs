    Haskell program that perform operations on vectors.

    NOTE: The operations Multplications and rotation are not working probably as
    they need a different parser format. I commented them out so please avoid
    using them. Thank you!

    deriving (Show, Read)

    The data type that will be used to decide which vector function to call to 
    perform the operation required by the user. Also stores the elements/vectors
    that will be used in that operation

-------------------------------PARSING COMMANDS---------------------------------

{- 
    The main parsing function. Uses the parse function imported from parsec and 
    also uses the function parseCommand to parse the operation given by the user
    and the vectors inputted 
-}
parserHelper :: String -> Either ParseError (Mode Double)
parserHelper = parse parseCommand []

{- 
    Checks whether a parse error was returned or a value. returns nothing if an 
    error occured and a just with the value if the value was correct.
-}
parseErrorChecker :: Either ParseError a -> Maybe a
parseErrorChecker (Right b) = Just b
parseErrorChecker (Left a) = Nothing

{- 
    Gets the value from the just and returns an error if it was a nothing
    as this means a parsing error occured.
-}
parserHelperCheck :: Maybe a -> a
parserHelperCheck (Just b) = b
parserHelperCheck Nothing = error "Couldn't parse the input probably"


{-
    The command where parsing mostly takes place. It maps the operation constant
    to the input and tries to match the string in the input to one that was in
    the operations list of strings, it then takes the vectors and give their
    output to parseCommandMap

        pure $ parseCommandMap command vecs

{-
    Parses the numbers given between brackets and separtes them by spaces. 
    Passes its output to vectorType to decide on which type of vector this is
    (either 2D or 3D)

    vector operation and returns it as a Mode.
